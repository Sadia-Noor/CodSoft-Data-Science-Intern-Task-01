# CodSoft Data Science Intern | Task#1 Titanic Survival Prediction

This the repository for my Data Science Internship at CodSoft. This includes my first Task. Using the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. I have done data preprocessing and applied different Machine Learning Models to see how each model perfom on this dataset.
